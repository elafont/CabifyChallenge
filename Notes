The challenge is solved with 4 entities

item: identify sellable articles on the shop and its price
ticket: identify a set of lines describing items purchased by a customer,
        it does keep track of the items added and the discounts appliable
line: each and every one of the items that compose a ticket
rules: set of rules to apply for discount based on the number of items purchased,
       the number it does occupy in the ticket and/or the price single/total to pay.
       Also enables to calculate a global discount based on number of items and/or price paid


There is a table precreated "todayDiscounts" that has the discounts suggested by the challenge, 
but other tables can be created as needed, the assignements of discounts are ticket based, so
it's posible to apply unique discounts to selected customers, or change the discounts at will, 
even on the fly based on ticket status.

There is no main app, as the tests shows how to use the code while testing its correctness
